## How do I apply for the tax relief for Foreign Special Professionals?
As a Gold Card holder working in Taiwan for the first time, for the portion of your salary over
 NT $3 million, half of it can be excluded from your effective income for your first three years
 of residence. eg if your salary was NT $6 million, you only pay tax on NT $4.5 million.

There is a special form accessible from both the Alien e-Filing system and the paper-based tax
 return application.

## If I have worked in Taiwan before, can I apply for the tax break?

Generally no, with some exceptions.

The relevant regulations are [here](https://law.moj.gov.tw/eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=G0340150%204).
 You can see in Article 3 that you need 3 ticks to be eligible:

1. First time coming to work
1. It’s special professional work
1. No household registration (only applicable to ROC nationals) and not a tax resident for the prior 5 years


With the exception that:

>  “If a foreign special professional has been previously approved to reside in the R.O.C. before
> his/her employment engaged in the professional work in the R.O.C., and such approval is not given
> on the ground of his/her engagement in the professional work, he/she shall not be subject to the
> first-time approval requirement…”

Which is unclear.

In 2019, [an interpretation](https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/News_Content.aspx?n=F0746484B877D582&s=AB4D1406453F1C22)
 was issued on this matter. An attempt to explain it is below, but this
 has not been validated by official sources.

If you came to Taiwan in 2015/2016/2017 and had a single 3/2/1 year work contract that ended in 2018
 and you became a Gold Card holder in 2018 and got a new contract … for financial year 2018 (and 2019
 and 2020) you can claim the Gold Card tax break.


You are not eligible under this interpretation if:

* you worked in Taiwan before 2015
* your contract didn’t extend into 2018
* you had multiple contracts between 2015 and 2018.
* you became a gold card holder in 2019

## When do I file tax in Taiwan?
The financial year is January 1st to December 31st. Tax is filed each year in May.
