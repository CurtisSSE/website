## Can I purchase real-estate?
In general, yes, if your country allows Taiwanese nationals to purchase real estate in your
 country. There are some restrictions, such as not being able to purchase farmland, or land
 related to a waterway or national defense.

## Does my card look any different from other types of ARC?
Yes, the entire card is gold in colour. It also has slightly different information such as a
 different title (R.O.C. (Taiwan) Employment Gold Card), purpose of residence (Foreign Special
 Professional) and a label for your professional field.

## How do I register to use the e-Gate?
Visit your local NIA service center or the immigration counter at an international airport and the
officials there will guide you through the steps.

## What unofficial benefits does holding a Gold Card bestow?
Sometimes the National Development Council or other government agencies invite us to parties or ask
 our opinions on certain matters.

## What happens if I change my address?
You must log in to the Gold Card Application portal and update your details there within 14 days of
 moving.

## How many days per year do I have to stay in Taiwan?
There are no requirements. However, you must stay for more than 183 days per year in order to be
 eligible for many benefits such as: tax resident treatment and a pathway to permanent residence.
