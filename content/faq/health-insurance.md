## What health insurance is available in Taiwan?
All who are eligible for National Health Insurance must enrol in the program (your employer will do
 this for you), which provides comprehensive and inexpensive coverage. There are also a range of
 private health insurance options.

## I'm a freelancer/I don't have an employer, how do I register with the NHI?
At present, you must reside in Taiwan for a consecutive six-month period (or leave only once for
 less than 30 days) and apply directly with the NHI. There is currently a
 [legislative push](https://www.ndc.gov.tw/en/Content_List.aspx?n=999F9864EFDB5F6F&upn=6CE244D6E7DAF831)
 to improve this, lead by the National Development Council.
