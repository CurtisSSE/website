---

The Gold Card Leadership Team is a set of individuals who are
elected by the Gold Card Community to act in the best interest of the community.

# Responsibilities
1. Ensure our community remains safe and enjoyable for its diverse membership
1. Be the point of escalation for community decision making
1. Moderate our communication channels
1. Protect community member's information, such as via the registration process
1. Coordinate community volunteers for projects that improve our community

# Elections
To be considered as a candiate for election, any member of the Gold Card
 Community may self-nominate, or be nominated by others and accept the nomination.

Elections are held every 6 months in August and February, and will be
organised by an independent member of the community who is neither a member of the
Leadership Team nor a candidate for election.

Polling will use the Condorcet or Single-Transferrable-Vote (STV) method.

For the initial election in February 2022, 5 leaders will be elected.

# Honorary Positions
To ensure a smooth transition after the first election, and to acknowledge
the large amount of time and effort in stewarding the community to date, two honorary
positions will be created. These positions will be held by Eric Khun and Tom Fifield.
