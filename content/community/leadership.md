# Elections
Any member of the Gold Card Community may self-nominate to be considered as

Elections are held every 6 months in August and February, and will be
organised by an independent member of the community who is neither a member of the
Leadership Team nor a candidate for election.

Polling will use the Condorcet or Single-Transferrable-Vote (STV) method.

For the initial election in February 2022, 5 leaders will be elected.
