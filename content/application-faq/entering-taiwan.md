Congratulations! The long and hard part is now over: you've been deemed sufficiently
skilled to hold a Gold Card.


### Card Collection in Taiwan
It's time to collect your card at the location you selected during the application process.

If you applied from overseas you will collect your card in Taiwan. Present your passport at [National Immigration Agency](https://goo.gl/maps/ixChB7yCWg7cVoSu9) to collect your card.


### Do I need a COVID-19 negative test to enter Taiwan? 
[Starting from December 1, 2020, until February 28, 2021](https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En/Bulletin/Detail/KIUJU0aZex70DPFUN3d66w?typeid=158&fbclid=IwAR3ITZrqBAkN-bCMZWmJbjxF4wS5XZlmLP7pP8ubK7mpqLeqsIhe8LuMTTk), you'll need a certificate of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test result issued within three working days to be able to enter in Taiwan.

### Do I need to enter Taiwan right away? 
You don't need to go to Taiwan straight away: some people take months to prepare for their arrival.
However, see the answer for [When does the gold card's validity begin?](/goldcard-holders-faq/validity/) to determine whether that affects you.

### Do you have a list of quarantine Hotels?
The official website listing quarantine hotels is [located here](https://english.gov.taipei/News_Content.aspx?n=A0EDC3930FBE7EFC&sms=5B794C46F3CDE718&s=6CBBBD4737D9391D). However, one of  the Gold Card Holder put together a more 
[comprehensible list of quarantine hotels](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oRHH940z2Wa6taqW5aXERu38eSKQBsBGHDEM1m226pM/edit?usp=sharing).
