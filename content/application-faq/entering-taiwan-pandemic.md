> **Taiwan does everything to keep its island safe**. During the pandemic, all the regulation regarding the entry-exit of the country changes on a day to day basis. Please check the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.mofa.gov.tw/en/Default.html) and the [CDC (Taiwan Center of Disease Control)](https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En), and [BOCA (Bureau of Consular Affairs)](https://www.boca.gov.tw/mp-2.html) websites for the latest information.

## Can I enter in Taiwan with a Gold Card during the pandemic?
Yes. If you have the physical Gold Card, you can enter Taiwan. You will need to show the card at the airline check-in counter. The Employment Gold Card is a "4-in-1" document that includes a Work Permit, Resident Visa, ARC (Alien Resident Certificate) and Multiple Re-entry Permit.

## What if I don't have the physical card yet?
You don't need the physical Gold Card to enter in Taiwan during the pandemic. Just download your Resident Authorization Letter from the [portal](https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card) and print it. Your airline will need to see this as proof of your ability to enter Taiwan, and you'll show it to the border agent in Taiwan. After arriving, you may visit the  [National Immigration Agency](https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141386/127061/127076/) to collect your card

## Do I need to do a COVID19 test to enter Taiwan?
Yes. [Starting from December 1, 2020, until February 28, 2021](https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En/Bulletin/Detail/KIUJU0aZex70DPFUN3d66w?typeid=158&fbclid=IwAR3ITZrqBAkN-bCMZWmJbjxF4wS5XZlmLP7pP8ubK7mpqLeqsIhe8LuMTTk), you'll need a certificate of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test result issued within three working days of flight boarding. If the flight has layovers, it’s the first flight departing, not necessarily the one to Taiwan. **Only nucleic acid tests (PCR, RT-PCR, NAA, NA) tests are accepted - the kind that needs a nasal swab.** Typical PCR tests return results in one or two days; if there's a research university near you, they may offer 24 hour results. **"Rapid" antigen tests and antibody tests are not accepted.** Print out your results to show at airline check-in; **ensure your name and test sample collection date are printed on the results.**

## Do I need to quarantine when entering Taiwan?
Yes. [Starting January 15, 2021, at 00:00](https://www.boca.gov.tw/cp-220-5081-c06dc-2.html), apart from the original requirement of providing a COVID-19 RT-PCR test report issued within three days of boarding, arriving travelers must also provide proof of the location of their intended quarantine. In principle, travelers should quarantine at a group quarantine facility or quarantine hotel; those who choose to quarantine at home must sign an affidavit declaring they have met the requirement of one person per residence. The CECC will further adjust entry restrictions and quarantine regulations in response to global pandemic developments and the effectiveness of antipandemic measures.

## Can I bring my family with me?
Yes. [Spouses and minor children of Gold Card Holders can enter in Taiwan](https://www.mofa.gov.tw/en/News_Content_M_2.aspx?n=1EADDCFD4C6EC567&s=AF89D9C1A1DA8594). The spouse and each minor child are required to have a  Visa (that you can obtain after being approved for the Gold Card) in order to enter. However, it is unclear if ascendants are allowed to enter. Please check with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - (+886) 2-2343-2888 - for the latest information

## Do you have a list of quarantine Hotels?
The official website listing Taipei's quarantine hotels is [located here](https://english.gov.taipei/News_Content.aspx?n=A0EDC3930FBE7EFC&sms=5B794C46F3CDE718&s=6CBBBD4737D9391D). One of the Gold Card Holder, [Patrick](https://twitter.com/rottendoubt), put together a more 
[comprehensible list of quarantine hotels](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oRHH940z2Wa6taqW5aXERu38eSKQBsBGHDEM1m226pM/edit?usp=sharing). 

For those wanting/needing to quarantine in other parts of the island, there is not any official lists. However [https://taiwan.taiwanstay.net.tw/covhotel/](https://taiwan.taiwanstay.net.tw/covhotel/) is an unofficial list managed by the Taiwan tourism bureau. While we'd imagine it's pretty up-to-date, each city's hotline is still the only official way to get accurate, up-to-date information.  (Hotline number's are listed on that page as well). 

## Can I quarantine at home?
Those who choose to quarantine at home must sign an affidavit declaring they have met the requirement of [one person per residence](https://www.mofa.gov.tw/en/News_Content_M_2.aspx?n=1EADDCFD4C6EC567&s=AF89D9C1A1DA8594). You are also allowed to quarantine at a friend or relatives’ unit.

_Non official and shared by a community member:_ Each adult must have their own bedroom and bathroom. (They were told this explicitly on multiple occasions when they had relatives dialing 1922 for us to inquire about it, and then again at the airport quarantine desk when we entered).  Also, minor children are allowed to quarantine with one of their parents at quarantine hotels, and minor children are not required to have their own separate bedroom/bathroom for home quarantine.

Please check with the CDC - +886 800 001922 - for the latest information.


## Can I quarantine with family member flying with me? 
It's unclear. **There is no announcement available regarding quarantine together with family**. Some gold card members in the [community](https://taiwangoldcard.com/community/) shared that husband and wife cannot stay in the same hotel room together, unless there is a medical need for one to take care of another. In the case of a hotel suite, there must be separate bedrooms and bathrooms in order for a couple to stay in the same suite.  

An other member shared that they were told each adult must have their own bedroom and bathroom. (They were told this explicitly on multiple occasions when they had relatives dialing 1922 for us to inquire about it, and then again at the airport quarantine desk when we entered).  Also, minor children are allowed to quarantine with one of their parents at quarantine hotels, and minor children are not required to have their own separate bedroom/bathroom for home quarantine.

Please check with the CDC - +886 800 001922 - for the latest information.

## Are Airbnb rentals allowed?
It's unclear. It depends on how long is the rental. Some gold card members in the [community](https://taiwangoldcard.com/community/) shared that you are NOT allowed to quarantine in a “short term rental” in Taipei city. “Short term rental” defined as less than 30 days. It doesn’t matter which web platform you book it on, they go by the number of days. This seems to imply that booking a unit for 30+ days should be okay. Please check with the CDC - +886 800 001922 - before doing so. We highly recommend [the list of hotels approved by the government](https://english.gov.taipei/News_Content.aspx?n=A0EDC3930FBE7EFC&sms=5B794C46F3CDE718&s=6CBBBD4737D9391D) to avoid any surprise.

_Non official and shared by a community member:_ Even if municipalities have grey-area rules that may allow for it for over 30+ days (and that's a big "if" as it's really not clear either way), almost all apartment buildings do not allow it as a building policy, and as such, renters may experience (and have experienced) a lot of issues or pushback from apartment building staff and neighbors if they are caught quarantining in units that are not their's (even if staying 30+ days). 

## How do I get to my hotel / home from the airport?
During the pandemic, special taxis will be waiting for you at the airport. You don't need to book them. For travel to some parts in the south, you have the option of either taxi ride OR a bus.

Regarding taxi price, [it is subsidized by the government for quarantine and has a fixed capped price accoring to each destination](https://www.taoyuan-airport.com/main_en/docdetail.aspx?uid=4010&pid=4010&docid=39435). For passengers going to Taipei, New Taipei, Keelung, Taoyuan and Hsinchu they will only be charged a maximum of NT$1,000.
For other parts, we can find [online](https://tw.forumosa.com/t/employment-gold-card-for-some-foreigners/159653/1985) that [a trip to Kaohsiung (that should have cost 10,000 NTD, ended up paying 2,660 NTD](https://tw.forumosa.com/t/employment-gold-card-for-some-foreigners/159653/1985).

You will see the meter running, but what you will pay at the end of the trip (cash or card) will be the fixed rate.
