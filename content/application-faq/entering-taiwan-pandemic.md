## Can I enter in Taiwan with a Gold Card?
Yes. If you got approved for the Gold Card, you are allowed to enter Taiwan. The Employment Gold Card isn't a visa, it is an enhanced resident permit (also called Alien Resident Certificate, or ARC).

## Do I need the physical gold card to enter Taiwan?
You don't need the physical Gold Card to enter in Taiwan during the pandemic. Just download your Resident Authorization Letter from the [portal](https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card) and print it. Your airline will need to see this as proof of your ability to enter Taiwan, and you'll show it to the border agent in Taiwan. After arriving, you may visit the  [National Immigration Agency](https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141386/127061/127076/) to collect your card

Maybe - You are NOT allowed to quarantine in a “short term rental” in Taipei city. “Short term rental” defined as less than 30 days.
