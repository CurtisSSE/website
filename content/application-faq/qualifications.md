## Do I qualify?
See [How to apply for Taiwan's Employment Gold Card](http://blog.tomfifield.net/2018/05/how-to-apply-for-taiwans-immigration.html)

## Is there an age restriction? 
Not really. However it is expected that gold card holders will have at least five years of work experience.

 ## Do I need to have a high salary to apply for a Gold Card?
No. Most industries have a category where applicants with a salary greater than NT$160,000 qualify.
 However, this is only one category. To date, none of the categories other than the dedicated
 salary category have financial requirements. If you have skills, please consider applying
 regardless of salary!

## What documents do you need to provide to prove your salary?
The last tax return from your last employers. Freelancing income doesn't count. 

## I currently live in Taiwan. Does my professional services/sole proprietor/dividend income count towards the salary requirement for Gold Card application?
TBA

## I'm a digital nomad / remote worker, is this card suitable for me? Can I be self-employed?
Yes, this card is perfect for you, since it contains an open work permit that allows you to work for any employer. However, if you don't have a Taiwanese employer please see the answer to: I'm a freelancer/I don't have an employer, how do I register with the NHI?.
