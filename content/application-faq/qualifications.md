## Do I qualify?
See [How to apply for Taiwan's Employment Gold Card](http://blog.tomfifield.net/2018/05/how-to-apply-for-taiwans-immigration.html)

## Is there an age restriction? 
Not really. However it is expected that gold card holders will have at least five years of work experience.

## Do I need to have a high salary to apply for a Gold Card?
No. Most industries have a category where applicants with a salary greater than NT$160,000 qualify. However, this is only one category. To date, none of the categories other than the dedicated salary category have financial requirements. If you have skills, please consider applying regardless of salary!

## What documents do you need to provide to prove your salary?
The last tax return from your last employers. Freelancing income, or your company income doesn't count.

## Does my professional services/sole proprietor/dividend income count towards the salary requirement for Gold Card application?
Generally not, but it depends. The document requirements to prove an Article 1 ("salary") application all talk about "...verifying salary or income tax payment related to employment...". The most commonly accepted documents appear to be withholding tax statements from employers and income tax returns from a tax authority. If you don't have salary-based compensation for your employment, we recommend calling ahead.

## I currently live in Taiwan, can I apply for the Gold Card?
Yes. You can apply from anywhere, even within Taiwan.

## I have an ARC, can I apply for the Gold Card?
Yes.

## I have a tourist visa in Taiwan, can I apply for the Gold Card?
Yes.

## I'm a digital nomad / remote worker, is this card suitable for me? Can I be self-employed?
Yes, this card is perfect for you, since it contains an open work permit that allows you to work for any employer. However, if you don't have a Taiwanese employer please see the answer to: I'm a freelancer/I don't have an employer, how do I register with the NHI?.
