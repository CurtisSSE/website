Taiwan Employment Gold Card is a special visa launched in 2018 to attract "special" talents in Taiwan. 
It gives you the right to stay and work in Taiwan from 1 year up to 3 years (renewable). You'll be able to work for any company, start a new business, have great tax incentives,  benefit Taiwan healthcare system, and bring your family with you.

The application is online, and straight forward. Approbation is based on your existing skills. You don't need  to already have a job or any company to sponsor you. The visa costs, depending of your nationality and the duration of the visa, from USD100 to USD310.
