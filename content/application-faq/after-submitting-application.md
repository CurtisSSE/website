## What happens after you submit your application?
1. Your qualifications will be assessed.
    1. First, the Ministry of Labor will attempt to sign off on the work permit. If it can do this itself (eg you apply based on the salary criteria and provide the right documents), your application will be swift (one case took just two days).
    1. If the Ministry of Labor can't vet your skills, it will call in the appropriate Ministry (eg "Science and Technology) to assist. That Ministry will then create a custom panel of judges who are skilled in your area of application. This takes some time, and if you are skilled in a niche area expect the application to take longer than 30 days at this stage.
1. Your identity will be verified
    1. If you are overseas, you will visit the nearest Taiwanese diplomatic post
    1. If you are in Taiwan, you will visit the Bureau of Consular Affairs
1. A final review is conducted by the Ministry of Interior
1. Your Gold Card will be issued.
    1. Claim it in Taiwan at the National Immigration Agency
    1. Claim it at your nearest diplomatic post

## How do you get your physical card?
Either at the National Immigration Agency service centres (in Taiwan) or at your local Taiwanese
 diplomatic post overseas. You selected where during your application.

## How long does the application take?
A perfect application takes 30 days, if your supporting documents are accepted the first time around. If you are asked for tweaks to your supporting documents, expect 50-60 days.

During the pandemic, we have seen 'normal' applications take as long as 80 days. Applicants who
elected to pick their card up overseas are severely affected by the pandemic's impact on the postal
network.

## What is a "Resident Authorization Letter"?
If you applied for your Gold Card from outside Taiwan but elected to collect your card
on arrival, you may use the "Resident Authorization Letter" to enter Taiwan. After arriving,
 you may visit the National Immigration Agency to collect your card.
