## How do you get your physical card?
Either at the National Immigration Agency service centres (in Taiwan) or at your local Taiwanese
 diplomatic post overseas. You selected where during your application.

## How long does the application take?
A perfect application takes 30 days, if your supporting documents are accepted the first time
 around. If you are asked for tweaks to your supporting documents, expect 50-60 days.
