**Current News about the 14-Day Quarantine Period  
updated August 3, 2020**

All visitors, including ROC passport holders, must undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine period. Taiwan is _very_ strict about the rules:

* For example, if you stay in certain facilities, you will not even be given a key to your room.
* You will also need to purchase a SIM card (or provide one if you already have it) to authorities, who will use it to check up on your location regularly. They will check!
* You will need a room that can provide for at least one bathroom per adult.

There is a list of government-specified hotels that can accommodate those in quarantine. These facilities will provide meal service.

Some private facilities may house you, but you will need to check with them first. Many hotels may refuse to house you during the quarantine period.

Some recent inbound travelers have booked AirBnB houses or cabins out in the middle of nowhere. I think in such a case, as long as it has a private area, you and the kids can spend time outdoors (unlike at a hotel).

For ROC passport (with 身分證) holders, you may be eligible for a NT1,000/day stipend from the Taiwan government covering the cost of accommodations for the Quarantine period to compensate you for being locked up. There may also be additional local benefits available.
