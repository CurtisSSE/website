## Health Insurance: A 6 month wait if you are "unemployed"

You must reside in Taiwan for a consecutive six-month period and apply directly with the NHI. This period starts from when you enter Taiwan. If you already are in Taiwan when you receive the gold card, the starting period is "issue date" written on the card. You are allowed to [leave only once for less than 30 days](https://www.nhi.gov.tw/english/Content_List.aspx?n=C88B41A4EAB5E692&topn=778856C209BCE527), and the length you left  Taiwan doesn't count for the six-month period.

**What are the solutions?**

- Find an employer, that will enroll you right after the start of your contract
- Get a private healthcare from your native country. Other gold card holders might have some recommendations. [Ask the community](https://forms.gle/K88uVy2jMW61DpT2A) and mention your nationality.

 There is currently a [legislative push to improve this](https://www.ndc.gov.tw/en/Content_List.aspx?n=999F9864EFDB5F6F&upn=6CE244D6E7DAF831), lead by the National Development Council.
