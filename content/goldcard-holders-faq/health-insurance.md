## What health insurance is available in Taiwan?
All who are eligible for National Health Insurance (NHI) must enrol into the program, which provides comprehensive and inexpensive coverage. Eligibility varies slightly depending on your employment status. If you aren't eligible for NHI then there are also a range of local and international private health insurance options available.

You can check the [NHI website](https://www.nhi.gov.tw/english/Content_List.aspx?n=C88B41A4EAB5E692&topn=778856C209BCE527) for more details.

## How do I enrol into the program
If you have an employer in Taiwan then they will enrol you into the program.

If you don't have an employer, and you are past the six month waiting period (see below), you can apply for your NHI card at your local national health administration bureau. The process is the same as for any resident in Taiwan. Please check with your [local office](https://www.nhi.gov.tw/DL.aspx?sitessn=293&u=LzAwMS9VcGxvYWQvMjkzL3JlbGZpbGUvMC8xOTkwMy9uaGlhZGRyZXNzbGlzdC5wZGY%3d&n=TkhJQWRkcmVzc0xpc3QucGRm) on what materials you will need to bring. It usually takes around seven working days.

## Are my children and family eligible for a health insurance card?
Yes. Once your spouse and/or any minor children receive their residence cards, they can register
 for their health insurance card as your dependants. They are immediately eligible and have
 no waiting period once you are enrolled in NHI, be sure to tell your employer about your
 dependants so they can update your enrolment information.

## I'm a freelancer/I don't have an employer, how do I register with the NHI?
At present, you must reside in Taiwan for a consecutive six-month period (or leave only once for less than 30 days) and apply directly with the NHI. There is currently a [legislative push](https://www.ndc.gov.tw/en/Content_List.aspx?n=999F9864EFDB5F6F&upn=6CE244D6E7DAF831)
 to improve this, lead by the National Development Council.

## I'm employed by a local company, do I still need to wait for the six-month period for a health insurance card?
You do not. Once the company registers your employment, you will be issued a health insurance card. 

## When does the six-month waiting period start?
For those who don't have a Taiwanese employer:
- If you applied for the Gold Card from abroad then the period starts when you enter Taiwan.
- If you applied for the Gold Card in Taiwan (e.g. on a tourist visa or visa-exempt) then the starting period is the "issue date" written on the card.

## Am I allowed to leave the country during the six-month period wait?
You are only allowed to [leave once for less than 30 days](https://www.nhi.gov.tw/english/Content_List.aspx?n=C88B41A4EAB5E692&topn=778856C209BCE527). Note that when you are away from Taiwan, the six-month waiting period will be paused. It will resume once you return to Taiwan.

For example, if you are in Taiwan for 3 months and then leave for 1 month, you will have to wait for 3 more months once you get back to Taiwan (7 months in total).

## I need a health insurance during the six-month waiting period - What are the solutions?
We know it's not ideal, but here some ways our community has solved this problem: 
- Find an employer, that will enroll you right after the start of the contract
- Get private health insurance. Other gold card holders might have some recommendations. [You can ask the community](https://forms.gle/K88uVy2jMW61DpT2A) and mention your nationality.

## Where can I see a list of NHI clinics close to me?
The NHI mobile app has a map-based search of all NHI facilities.
You can download it from the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nhiApp.v1) and the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E5%85%A8%E6%B0%91%E5%81%A5%E4%BF%9D%E8%A1%8C%E5%8B%95%E5%BF%AB%E6%98%93%E9%80%9A-%E5%81%A5%E5%BA%B7%E5%AD%98%E6%91%BA/id578186283)

## How are NHI premiums managed?
NHI premiums will be withheld from your salary payment. Standard premiums for professional employees
 are typically 1.41% of your salary, multiplied by the number of family members enrolled as your
 dependants. Some types of income attract a higher rate of 1.91% (eg bonuses and investment income).
There are income tax deductions available for NHI premium payments.
Official information and description of the many 'special' cases can be found on:
