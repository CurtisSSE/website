## What health insurance is available in Taiwan?
All who are eligible for National Health Insurance must enrol in the program (your employer will do this for you), which provides comprehensive and inexpensive coverage. There are also a range of private health insurance options.

## I'm a freelancer/I don't have an employer, how do I register with the NHI?
At present, you must reside in Taiwan for a consecutive six-month period (or leave only once for
 less than 30 days) and apply directly with the NHI. This period starts from when you enter Taiwan.
 There is currently a
 [legislative push](https://www.ndc.gov.tw/en/Content_List.aspx?n=999F9864EFDB5F6F&upn=6CE244D6E7DAF831)
 to improve this, lead by the National Development Council.
 
 ## If I'm employed by a local company, do I still need to wait for the six-month period for a health insurance card?
 You do not.  Once the company registers your employment, you will be issued a health insurance card. 
 
 ## Are my children and family eligible for a health insurance card?
 Yes. Once your spouse and/or any minor children receive their residence cards, they can register for their health insurance card as dependents of you.

## Where can I see a list of NHI clinics close to me?
The NHI mobile app has a map-based search of all NHI facilities.
You can download it from the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nhiApp.v1) and the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E5%85%A8%E6%B0%91%E5%81%A5%E4%BF%9D%E8%A1%8C%E5%8B%95%E5%BF%AB%E6%98%93%E9%80%9A-%E5%81%A5%E5%BA%B7%E5%AD%98%E6%91%BA/id578186283)
