## Can I purchase real-estate?
In general, yes, if your country allows Taiwanese nationals to purchase real estate in your
 country. There are some restrictions, such as not being able to purchase farmland, or land
 related to a waterway or national defense.

## Does my card look any different from other types of ARC?
Yes, the entire card is gold in colour. It also has slightly different information such as a
 different title (R.O.C. (Taiwan) Employment Gold Card), purpose of residence (Foreign Special
 Professional) and a label for your professional field.

## How do I register to use the e-Gate?
Visit your local NIA service center or the immigration counter at an international airport and the
officials there will guide you through the steps.

## What unofficial benefits does holding a Gold Card bestow?
- Because the Taiwan government see us as  "professional worthy" to get the  Gold Card, it could give you some leverage on the eyes of certain persons. Some people might pay more attention on your profile, what you say or would like to do.
- Sometimes the National Development Council or other government agencies invite us to parties or ask our opinions on certain matters.
