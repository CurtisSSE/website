## Can I purchase real-estate?
In general, yes, if your country allows Taiwanese nationals to purchase real estate in your
 country. There are some restrictions, such as not being able to purchase farmland, or land
 related to a waterway or national defense.

## Does my card look any different from other types of ARC?
Yes, the entire card is gold in colour. It also has slightly different information such as a
 different title (R.O.C. (Taiwan) Employment Gold Card), purpose of residence (Foreign Special
 Professional) and a label for your professional field.

## How do I register to use the e-Gate?
Visit your local NIA service center or the immigration counter at an international airport and the
officials there will guide you through the steps.

As the Taiwan government sees holders as "worthy professionals", this could increase your standing in
the eyes of certain people. Additionally, Sometimes the National Development Council or other
government agencies invite us to parties or ask our opinions on certain matters.

## How do I convert my overseas driving license?
Taiwan has international agreements with many countries that allow you to convert your driver's license
 from your home country into a Taiwanese license without taking a driving test. This is done on the
 basis of 'reciprocity' - basically if it is possible for a Taiwanese national to convert their license
 in your country you should be able to do the same in Taiwan. The Taipei City Motor Vehicles Office
 maintains a list of eligible countries (and states within countries), and instructions
 [on their website](https://tpcmv.thb.gov.tw/English/ServicesEng/LicenseEng/ManagementEng/ManagementEng02.htm).

If you are not from an eligible state or country and need to drive long-term, you will need to
 sit the local license test. For the short term, you may use an International Driving Permit from
 your home country, but after 30 days in Taiwan this must be extended by the local Motor Vehicles
 Office to remain valid.
