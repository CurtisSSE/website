## What do I need to tell my employer about the Gold Card?
Your Gold Card is a four-in-one document that contains your work permit, residence visa, reentry
 permit and Alien Residence Certificate. You have open work rights and they do not need to apply
 for a work permit or visa for you.

## What happens if I lose my job?
You may simply find a new job. Your Gold Card is not sponsored by your employer and will not be
 affected by a change of job.

## Can I start a business with a Gold Card?
Yes.

## Does the Gold Card provide an open work permit?
Yes. You may work for any organisation (or many organisations at the same time) in any industry,
 in any job, provided it doesn't have licensing requirements that you don't meet.

## Can I be self-employed?
Yes.

## Is there a minimum salary requirement for Gold Card holders?
Yes. It is one of:

* NT$23,800 a month, or NT$158 per hour for "workers" (Labor Standards Act Article 21)
* NT$47,971 a month for those performing "specialised or technical work" 

Despite many applicants qualifying for a gold card on the basis of previous employment with salary
 of greater than NT$160,000, this is not a minimum salary requirement. _However_, those applying
 under this category will have their financial data reviewed by the Ministry of Labor. The
 regulations allow the Ministry of Labor to revoke a work permit if they are not satisfied with
 the results of this review.

## Can I work for multiple companies at the same time?
Yes.
