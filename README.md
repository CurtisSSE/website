Our goal is to:

1. Increase the profile of the Gold Card, cementing its position as a 'special' accomplishment
2. Rally the pool of Gold Card Holders to improve the life of all foreign residents in Taiwan
3. Raise the profile of Taiwan as a great place to live and work, so new talents are attracted in Taiwan
