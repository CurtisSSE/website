<div><p>Since February 2018, when the Gold Card was launched, card holders have been helping people apply
and integrate into life in Taiwan. We think that Taiwan is an amazing place to live and work, and
encourage you to apply for the Gold Card if you&rsquo;re eligible. An open work permit, tax benefits,
ability to bring your family - all applied for online and approved based on your existing skills,
no need to already have a job or a company to sponsor you.</p>
<p>This website is a compilation of answers to actual questions asked by Gold Card holders as they
went through the process. We welcome your questions and
<a href="https://github.com/taiwangoldcard/website">contributions</a>!</p>
<p>This site was designed by Gold card holders for Gold card holders, inspired by and brainstormed
with the unofficial Gold Card holder LINE group. The original site design
and technical implementation was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/eric_khun">Eric Khun</a> and the original
content was written by <a href="https://twitter.com/tomfifield">Tom Fifield</a>. Credit is also due to
<a href="https://tw.forumosa.com/t/employment-gold-card-for-some-foreigners">Forumosa</a>. Without the
community there, many people would never have discovered the Gold Card or made it through their
applications.</p>
