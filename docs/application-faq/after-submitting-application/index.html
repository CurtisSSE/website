<h2 id="what-happens-after-you-submit-your-application">What happens after you submit your application?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Your qualifications will be assessed.
<ol>
<li>First, the Ministry of Labor will attempt to sign off on the work permit. If it can do this itself (eg you apply based on the salary criteria and provide the right documents), your application will be swift (one case took just two days).</li>
<li>If the Ministry of Labor can&rsquo;t vet your skills, it will call in the appropriate Ministry (eg &ldquo;Science and Technology) to assist. That Ministry will then create a custom panel of judges who are skilled in your area of application. This takes some time, and if you are skilled in a niche area expect the application to take longer than 30 days at this stage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Your identity will be verified
<ol>
<li>If you are overseas, you will visit the nearest Taiwanese diplomatic post</li>
<li>If you are in Taiwan, you will visit the Bureau of Consular Affairs</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A final review is conducted by the Ministry of Interior</li>
<li>Your Gold Card will be issued.
<ol>
<li>Claim it in Taiwan at the National Immigration Agency</li>
<li>Claim it at your nearest diplomatic post</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-long-does-the-application-take">How long does the application take?</h2>
<p>A perfect application takes 30 days, if your supporting documents are accepted the first time around.
If you are asked for tweaks to your supporting documents, expect 50-60 days.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, we have seen &lsquo;normal&rsquo; applications take as long as 80 days. Applicants who
elected to pick their card up overseas are severely affected by the pandemic&rsquo;s impact on the postal
network.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-find-out-the-status-of-my-application">How do I find out the status of my application?</h2>
<p>Predominantly, you will find the status of your application by either logging in to the Gold Card
Application Portal, or receiving email updates from the portal. However, if the status hasn&rsquo;t updated in
a long time here&rsquo;s what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who to contact changes depending on the status of your application.</li>
<li>The mostly lengthy status you will see is &ldquo;Professional Review by Workforce Development Agency&rdquo;.
In this case, first, try the WDA, under the <em>Ministry of Labor for Employment Gold Card Permits
for Foreign Special Professionals</em> on the master contact list. They will probably tell you that
the application is with the relevant ministry for your skill set and provide contact details. If not,
try to contact the appropriate ministry under <em>Qualification of Foreign Special Professionals</em> on the master list</li>
<li>If your application is stuck on &ldquo;Under inspection&rdquo; after you already collected your passport,
contact the NIA - your card may already be printed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-you-get-your-physical-card">How do you get your physical card?</h2>
<p>Either at the National Immigration Agency service centres (in Taiwan) or at your local Taiwanese
diplomatic post overseas. You selected where during your application.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-do-if-im-asked-to-provide-additional-documents">What do I do if I&rsquo;m asked to provide additional documents?</h2>
<p>After a few weeks of tense wait, you may receive an email from <a href="mailto:niasys@immigration.gov.tw">niasys@immigration.gov.tw</a> that says
&ldquo;After the examination by the department and the enterprise competent authority, the relevant information shall be made up.&quot;.</p>
<p>Log in to the portal at:
<a href="https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card">https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card</a></p>
<p>Your application will be listed under &ldquo;Application cases of which data to be supplemented&rdquo;, click View.</p>
<p>Up the top of the application will be a block of red text in Chinese and English. It will attempt
to explain what additional documents are required. If it doesn&rsquo;t make sense, call the appropriate
ministry contact under Qualification of Foreign Special Professionals on the master list. They&rsquo;ll be
able to look up your application and provide more colour.</p>
<p>Once you know which documents to upload, prepare to upload them as with your previous application.
Additionally, prepare a short statement addressing how you have rectified the &ldquo;Opinion
on the Application&rdquo;. Select the documents for upload and paste the response in the &ldquo;Reply Comments&rdquo;
box at the bottom of the final page.</p>
<p><em>Important: Sometimes using English in the &ldquo;Reply Comments&rdquo; box will cause your application to fail
to be submitted with a cryptic error.</em></p>
<h2 id="i-applied-under-a-salary-provision-but-am-being-asked-for-additional-documents-unrelated-to-this-why">I applied under a salary provision, but am being asked for additional documents unrelated to this. Why?</h2>
<p>Don’t stress. This is normal. You’re applying under a financial requirement, but the relevant
ministry still wants to vet your skills. Under some interpretations of the regulations, they
are not supposed to do this, but here we are.</p>
<p>Gather up some documents that demonstrate you work in the industry and you’re good at it. Maybe a
letter from your boss talking about that time you created that innovative thing, a supporting
statement from a professor about how they’re proud of you, a piece of easily digestible work
product that has your name on it. It’ll depend on what you’ve got or can create - but get into
the mindset of the reviewer and aim to make it as easy as possible to understand why you are a
talent. If you feel the need, write a cover letter for your application explaining your skills.</p>
<h2 id="if-i-apply-in-taiwan-where-do-i-go-to-prove-my-identity">If I apply in Taiwan, where do I go to prove my identity?</h2>
<p>You must go to your local Bureau of Consular Affairs (BOCA). If you’re getting your passport
vetted at Taipei’s BOCA/MOFA office, here’s a quick how-to. (Don’t worry, the ‘pinball’
method - shuffling between volunteers - works well too).</p>
<ol>
<li>BOCA is open between 08:30 to 17:00 <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/mFt8PBMCGnD2">here</a> (a few blocks from Shandao Temple Station, Exit 2)</li>
<li>Enter the big pink building and go directly up the escalators to level 3</li>
<li>On 3F, ignore the ticket machine immediately in front of you and turn right and right again to be at the “Authentication” area</li>
<li>In the middle of the area, around counter 30, grab a ticket (if there is a problem, ask for help at the end counter - counter 28)</li>
<li>Go to the designated counter when your number is up, surrender your passport and online
application document, provide any details on upcoming travel, and receive your receipt.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-is-a-resident-authorization-letter">What is a &ldquo;Resident Authorization Letter&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>If you applied for your Gold Card from outside Taiwan but elected to collect your card
on arrival, you may use the &ldquo;Resident Authorization Letter&rdquo; to enter Taiwan. After arriving,
you may visit the National Immigration Agency to collect your card.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-need-to-fly-to-taiwan-immediately-after-approval">Do you need to fly to Taiwan immediately after approval?</h2>
<p>No. Some people took several months to prepare for their arrival. However, see the answer for
<em>When does the gold card&rsquo;s validity begin?</em> to determine whether that affects you.</p>
