      <description>Do I qualify? See How to apply for Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s Employment Gold Card
Is there an age restriction? Not really. However it is expected that gold card holders will have at least five years of work experience.
Do I need to have a high salary to apply for a Gold Card? If you have your last salary greater than NT$160,000 (around USD5,400), you qualify under the &amp;ldquo;economy&amp;rdquo; category. We insist on the word salary.</description>

      <description>Who can I talk to about this? You&amp;rsquo;re in for some serious luck here! The Gold Card comes with some direct contacts who are high level and exceptionally helpful. However, first it is critical to understand that this program is a collaboration of disparate Government departments who aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily in constant communication with each other. You will need to choose a department to contact depending on the stage of your application.</description>

      <description>What happens after you submit your application?  Your qualifications will be assessed.  First, the Ministry of Labor will attempt to sign off on the work permit. If it can do this itself (eg you apply based on the salary criteria and provide the right documents), your application will be swift (one case took just two days). If the Ministry of Labor can&amp;rsquo;t vet your skills, it will call in the appropriate Ministry (eg &amp;ldquo;Science and Technology) to assist.</description>
