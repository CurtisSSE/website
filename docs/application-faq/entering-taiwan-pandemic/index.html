    <h1>Entering Taiwan during the pandemic</h1><blockquote>
<p><strong>Taiwan does everything to keep its island safe</strong>. During the pandemic, all the regulation regarding the entry-exit of the country changes on a day to day basis. Please check the <a href="https://www.mofa.gov.tw/en/Default.html">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En">CDC (Taiwan Center of Disease Control)</a>, and <a href="https://www.boca.gov.tw/mp-2.html">BOCA (Bureau of Consular Affairs)</a> websites for the latest information.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="can-i-enter-in-taiwan-with-a-gold-card-during-the-pandemic">Can I enter in Taiwan with a Gold Card during the pandemic?</h2>
<p>Yes. If you have the physical Gold Card, you can enter Taiwan. You will need to show the card at the airline check-in counter. The Employment Gold Card is a &ldquo;4-in-1&rdquo; document that includes a Work Permit, Resident Visa, ARC (Alien Resident Certificate) and Multiple Re-entry Permit.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-i-dont-have-the-physical-card-yet">What if I don&rsquo;t have the physical card yet?</h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need the physical Gold Card to enter in Taiwan during the pandemic. Just download your Resident Authorization Letter from the <a href="https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card">portal</a> and print it. Your airline will need to see this as proof of your ability to enter Taiwan, and you&rsquo;ll show it to the border agent in Taiwan. After arriving, you may visit the  <a href="https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141386/127061/127076/">National Immigration Agency</a> to collect your card</p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-to-do-a-covid19-test-to-enter-taiwan">Do I need to do a COVID19 test to enter Taiwan?</h2>
<p>Yes. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En/Bulletin/Detail/KIUJU0aZex70DPFUN3d66w?typeid=158&amp;fbclid=IwAR3ITZrqBAkN-bCMZWmJbjxF4wS5XZlmLP7pP8ubK7mpqLeqsIhe8LuMTTk">Starting from December 1, 2020, until February 28, 2021</a>, you&rsquo;ll need a certificate of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test result issued within three working days of flight boarding. If the flight has layovers, it’s the first flight departing, not necessarily the one to Taiwan. <strong>Only nucleic acid tests (PCR, RT-PCR, NAA, NA) tests are accepted - the kind that needs a nasal swab.</strong> Typical PCR tests return results in one or two days; if there&rsquo;s a research university near you, they may offer 24 hour results. <strong>&ldquo;Rapid&rdquo; antigen tests and antibody tests are not accepted.</strong> Print out your results to show at airline check-in; <strong>ensure your name and test sample collection date are printed on the results.</strong></p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-to-quarantine-when-entering-taiwan">Do I need to quarantine when entering Taiwan?</h2>
<p>Yes. <a href="https://www.boca.gov.tw/cp-220-5081-c06dc-2.html">Starting January 15, 2021, at 00:00</a>, apart from the original requirement of providing a COVID-19 RT-PCR test report issued within three days of boarding, arriving travelers must also provide proof of the location of their intended quarantine. In principle, travelers should quarantine at a group quarantine facility or quarantine hotel; those who choose to quarantine at home must sign an affidavit declaring they have met the requirement of one person per residence. The CECC will further adjust entry restrictions and quarantine regulations in response to global pandemic developments and the effectiveness of antipandemic measures.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-bring-my-family-with-me">Can I bring my family with me?</h2>
<p>Yes. <a href="https://www.mofa.gov.tw/en/News_Content_M_2.aspx?n=1EADDCFD4C6EC567&amp;s=AF89D9C1A1DA8594">Spouses and minor children of Gold Card Holders can enter in Taiwan</a>.  However, it is unclear if ascendants are allowed to enter. Please check with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs :(+886) 2-2343-2888 - for the latest information.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-have-a-list-of-quarantine-hotels">Do you have a list of quarantine Hotels?</h2>
<p>The official website listing quarantine hotels is <a href="https://english.gov.taipei/News_Content.aspx?n=A0EDC3930FBE7EFC&amp;sms=5B794C46F3CDE718&amp;s=6CBBBD4737D9391D">located here</a>. One of the Gold Card Holder, <a href="https://twitter.com/rottendoubt">Patrick</a>, put together a more
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oRHH940z2Wa6taqW5aXERu38eSKQBsBGHDEM1m226pM/edit?usp=sharing">comprehensible list of quarantine hotels</a>.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-quarantine-at-home">Can I quarantine at home?</h2>
<p>Those who choose to quarantine at home must sign an affidavit declaring they have met the requirement of <a href="https://www.mofa.gov.tw/en/News_Content_M_2.aspx?n=1EADDCFD4C6EC567&amp;s=AF89D9C1A1DA8594">one person per residence</a>. You are also allowed to quarantine at a friend or relatives’ unit. Please check with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs :(+886) 2-2343-2888 - for the latest information.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-quarantine-with-family-member-flying-with-me">Can I quarantine with family member flying with me?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear. <strong>There is no announcement available regarding quarantine together with family</strong>. Some gold card members in the <a href="https://taiwangoldcard.com/community/">community</a> shared that husband and wife cannot stay in the same hotel room together, unless there is a medical need for one to take care of another. In the case of a hotel suite, there must be separate bedrooms and bathrooms in order for a couple to stay in the same suite.  Please check with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs :(+886) 2-2343-2888 - for the latest information.</p>
<h2 id="are-airbnb-rentals-allowed">Are Airbnb rentals allowed?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear. It depends on how long is the rental. Some gold card members in the <a href="https://taiwangoldcard.com/community/">community</a> shared that you are NOT allowed to quarantine in a “short term rental” in Taipei city. “Short term rental” defined as less than 30 days. It doesn’t matter which web platform you book it on, they go by the number of days. This seems to imply that booking a unit for 30+ days should be okay, but please confirm  with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs -(+886) 2-2343-2888 - before doing so. We highly recommend <a href="https://english.gov.taipei/News_Content.aspx?n=A0EDC3930FBE7EFC&amp;sms=5B794C46F3CDE718&amp;s=6CBBBD4737D9391D">the list of hotels approved by the government</a> to avoid any surprise.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-get-to-my-hotel--home-from-the-airport">How do I get to my hotel / home from the airport?</h2>
<p>During the pandemic, special taxis will be waiting for you at the airport. You don&rsquo;t need to book them.</p>
<p><strong>There is no official announcement</strong> regarding price. But we can find <a href="https://tw.forumosa.com/t/employment-gold-card-for-some-foreigners/159653/1985">online</a> that taxi price is subsidized by the government for quarantine, and can bring you anywhere in Taiwan. You will see the meter running, but what you will pay at the end of the trip (cash or card) is a fixed rate. <a href="https://tw.forumosa.com/t/employment-gold-card-for-some-foreigners/159653/1985">For a trip to Kaohsiung (that should have cost 10,000 NTD, ended up paying 2,660 NTD</a>.</p>
