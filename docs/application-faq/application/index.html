<h2 id="who-can-i-talk-to-about-this">Who can I talk to about this?</h2>
<p>See <a href="http://blog.tomfifield.net/2018/05/how-to-apply-for-taiwans-immigration.html">How to apply for Taiwan&rsquo;s Employment Gold Card</a></p>
<h2 id="how-to-apply">How to apply?</h2>
<p>See <a href="http://blog.tomfifield.net/2018/05/how-to-apply-for-taiwans-immigration.html">How to apply for Taiwan&rsquo;s Employment Gold Card</a></p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-general-application-category-or-must-i-select-a-specific-industry">Is there a &ldquo;general&rdquo; application category or must I select a specific industry?</h2>
<p>There is no &ldquo;general&rdquo; application category. You must select a ministry to assess your skills.
See <a href="http://blog.tomfifield.net/2018/05/how-to-apply-for-taiwans-immigration.html">How to apply for Taiwan&rsquo;s Employment Gold Card</a></p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-the-application-take">How long does the application take?</h2>
<p>A perfect application takes 30 days, if your supporting documents are accepted the first time
around. If you are asked for tweaks to your supporting documents, expect 50-60 days.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-to-list-an-address-in-taiwan-on-the-application">Do I need to list an address in Taiwan on the application?</h2>
<p>It’s entirely normal and accepted to apply with no local address. Once you get a place to stay,
you can (must) update the details on your card, free of charge.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-need-to-fly-to-taiwan-immediately-after-approval">Do you need to fly to Taiwan immediately after approval?</h2>
<p>No. Some people took several months to prepare for their arrival. However, see the answer for
<em>When does the gold card&rsquo;s validity begin?</em> to determine whether that affects you.</p>
<!-- TODO: need to link to this answer. -->
<h2 id="if-i-apply-in-taiwan-where-do-i-go-to-prove-my-identity">If I apply in Taiwan, where do I go to prove my identity?</h2>
<p>You must go to your local Bureau of Consular Affairs (BOCA) If you’re getting your passport
vetted at Taipei’s BOCA/MOFA office, here’s a quick howto. (Don’t worry, the ‘pinball’
method - shuffling between volunteers - works well too).</p>
<ol>
<li>BOCA is open between 08:30 to 17:00 <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/mFt8PBMCGnD2">here</a> (a few blocks from Shandao Temple Station, Exit 2)</li>
<li>Enter the big pink building and go directly up the escalators to level 3</li>
<li>On 3F, ignore the ticket machine immediately in front of you and turn right and right again to be at the “Authentication” area</li>
<li>In the middle of the area, around counter 30, grab a ticket (if there is a problem, ask for help at the end counter - counter 28)</li>
<li>Go to the designated counter when your number is up, surrender your passport and online
application document, provide any details on upcoming travel, and receive your receipt.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="do-i-apply-for-the-gold-card-personally-or-should-i-ask-my-employer-to-do-that">Do I apply for the Gold Card personally, or should I ask my employer to do that?</h2>
<p>Generally you should apply personally. Employers can help with the process, but you do not need
their sponsorship or support to apply for the card. Additionally, the card once issued contains
an open work permit that allows you to work for any company.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-decide-the-duration-to-apply-for-1-3-years">How do I decide the duration to apply for (1-3 years)?</h2>
<p>You select this during the application process. You could go for a shorter duration if you have
concrete plans. Otherwise, it’s probably better to go for a longer duration. There is no justification needed on how long you&rsquo;d like to stay. This costs more, but delays the hassle of finding the next visa (or going through the gold card application process again).</p>
<h2 id="do-you-need-to-undergo-a-health-check-to-apply-for-the-gold-card">Do you need to undergo a health check to apply for the Gold Card?</h2>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t heard of anyone to date who required a health check, so it&rsquo;s not a normal part of the
process at least.</p>
<h2 id="what-fees-are-involved-in-a-gold-card-application">What fees are involved in a Gold Card application?</h2>
<p>There is only one fee, which is paid through the Gold Card application portal. There are no separate visa or work permit fees.</p>
<p>The fees varies if you apply from Taiwan or oversea,  duration of the visa, and your nationality. You can check <a href="https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card">this page, on the  &ldquo;Fees for Employment Gold Card&rdquo; section</a>.</p>
<h2 id="im-worried-that-my-application-will-be-rejected-because-i-didnt-attach-enough-documents">I&rsquo;m worried that my application will be rejected because I didn&rsquo;t attach enough documents.</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t stress. The authorities will ask for more documents if the ones you provided were not
sufficient. It’ll just extend the processing time by a couple of weeks to a month.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-anything-certified-by-the-administration-of-my-own-country">Do I need anything certified by the administration of my own country?</h2>
<p>In general, no. However, there have been a very small number of cases (eg credentials from mainland China) where some action was required by a government other than Taiwan.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-the-application-process-different-if-i-apply-from-overseas">How is the application process different if I apply from overseas?</h2>
<p>Applying from overseas or from within Taiwan is the same process. It differs only in which unit
verifies your passport (TECO or BOCA), and overseas applicants have the option of picking up
their card from TECO.</p>
<p>If you live far from your local Taiwanese diplomatic post, it is recommended to call before going
to give them a heads up. It’s highly likely that you’re the first person ever to go through this
process in a particular office and giving them a day or two head start to let them call back to
Taiwan and work out what to do when you arrive could be useful.</p>
<h2 id="i-applied-under-a-salary-provision-but-am-being-asked-for-additional-documents-unrelated-to-this-why">I applied under a salary provision, but am being asked for additional documents unrelated to this. Why?</h2>
<p>Don’t stress. This is normal. You’re applying under a financial requirement, but the relevant
ministry still wants to vet your skills. Under some interpretations of the regulations, they
are not supposed to do this, but here we are.</p>
<p>Gather up some documents that demonstrate you work in the industry and you’re good at it. Maybe a
letter from your boss talking about that time you created that innovative thing, a supporting
statement from a professor about how they’re proud of you, a piece of easily digestible work
product that has your name on it. It’ll depend on what you’ve got or can create - but get into
the mindset of the reviewer and aim to make it as easy as possible to understand why you are a
talent. If you feel the need, write a cover letter for your application explaining your skills.</p>
