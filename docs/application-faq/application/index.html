<h2 id="how-to-apply">How to apply?</h2>
<p>Application is done online. Once you have determined how you are <a href="/application-faq/qualifications/">qualified</a>,
gather the required documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>digital copy of your passport</li>
<li>digital copy of your passport photo</li>
<li>locate your previous Taiwanese visa and residence permit (if any)</li>
<li>dates of any times you worked in Taiwan</li>
<li>digital copies of all documents needed to support your application</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: all digital copies need to be &lt;1MB in size in image or PDF format. You may need to use an image resizing tool.</em></p>
<p>Second, go to the portal:</p>
<p><a href="https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card">https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card</a></p>
<p>and click &ldquo;I want to apply&rdquo;. Select &ldquo;self application&rdquo;, click consent and create an account.</p>
<p>To make a new application, click Application&ndash;&gt;Application for Employment Gold Card &ndash;&gt; New Application.</p>
<p>Step through each of the sections, making sure you fill out each section before the ~5 minute timeout logs you out.
Click save on each page to see if there are any errors detected.</p>
<p><em>Note: the length of time you select for the card (eg 3 years) will determine its cost.</em></p>
<p>Eventually, view the preview and then hit submit!</p>
<p><em>Note: you will receive an email at this point telling you to pay. If you didn&rsquo;t get it, check your email address was correct.</em></p>
<p>You must then go through the payment steps in order for your application to be considered.</p>
<p><em>Note: you will receive an email at this point telling you to get your receipt. Follow the steps to download it, and print it out - you will need it to collect your card.</em></p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-the-application-take">How long does the application take?</h2>
<p>A perfect application takes 30 days, if your supporting documents are accepted the first time
around. If you are asked for tweaks to your supporting documents, expect 50-60 days.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-to-list-an-address-in-taiwan-on-the-application">Do I need to list an address in Taiwan on the application?</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s entirely normal and accepted to apply with no local address. Once you get a place to stay,
you can (must) update the details on your card, free of charge.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-apply-for-the-gold-card-personally-or-should-i-ask-my-employer-to-do-that">Do I apply for the Gold Card personally, or should I ask my employer to do that?</h2>
<p>Generally you should apply personally. Employers can help with the process, but you do not need
their sponsorship or support to apply for the card. Additionally, the card once issued contains
an open work permit that allows you to work for any company. If someone is asking you for large sums
of money to help with your gold card application, it could be a scam.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-decide-the-duration-to-apply-for-1-3-years">How do I decide the duration to apply for (1-3 years)?</h2>
<p>You select this during the application process. You could opt for a shorter duration if you have
concrete plans. Otherwise, itâ€™s probably better to select the longest duration. There is no
justification needed on how long you&rsquo;d like to stay. This costs more, but delays the hassle of
finding the next visa (or going through the gold card application process <a href="again">/goldcard-holders-faq/validity/</a>).</p>
<h2 id="do-you-need-to-undergo-a-health-check-to-apply-for-the-gold-card">Do you need to undergo a health check to apply for the Gold Card?</h2>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t heard of anyone to date who required a health check, so it&rsquo;s not a normal part of the
process at least.</p>
<h2 id="what-fees-are-involved-in-a-gold-card-application">What fees are involved in a Gold Card application?</h2>
<p>There is only one fee, which is paid through the Gold Card application portal. There are no separate visa or work permit fees.</p>
<p>The fees varies if you apply from Taiwan or overseas, the duration of the visa, and your nationality.
You can check <a href="https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card">the &ldquo;Fees for Employment Gold Card&rdquo; section of the application portal</a>.</p>
<h2 id="im-worried-that-my-application-will-be-rejected-because-i-didnt-attach-enough-documents">I&rsquo;m worried that my application will be rejected because I didn&rsquo;t attach enough documents.</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t stress. The authorities will ask for more documents if the ones you provided were not
sufficient. Itâ€™ll just extend the processing time by a couple of weeks to a month.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-to-have-anything-translated">Do I need to have anything translated?</h2>
<p>If your documents are not in English or Chinese, they probably need to be translated.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-to-have-anything-certified">Do I need to have anything certified?</h2>
<p>In general, no. However, if your documents are from the following countries, they probably need to be
certified by <a href="https://www.mofa.gov.tw/en/OverseasOfficeLink.aspx?n=1A4D7D5A68ECF4B9&amp;sms=A76B7230ADF29736">the Taiwan diplomatic post</a>
responsible for the country: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bengal,
Bhutan, China, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cuba, Ghana, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal,  Somalia, Sri Lanka, Syria, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-the-application-process-different-if-i-apply-from-overseas">How is the application process different if I apply from overseas?</h2>
<p>Applying from overseas or from within Taiwan is the same process. It differs only in which unit
verifies your passport (TECO or BOCA), and overseas applicants have the option of picking up
their card from TECO.</p>
<p>If you live far from your local Taiwanese diplomatic post, it is recommended to call before going
to give them a heads up. Itâ€™s highly likely that youâ€™re the first person ever to go through this
process in a particular office and giving them a day or two head start to let them call back to
Taiwan and work out what to do when you arrive could be useful.</p>
<h2 id="who-can-i-talk-to-about-this">Who can I talk to about this?</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re in for some serious luck here! The Gold Card comes with some direct contacts who are
high level and exceptionally helpful. However, first it is critical to understand that this
program is a collaboration of disparate Government departments who aren&rsquo;t necessarily in constant
communication with each other. You will need to choose a department to contact depending on the
stage of your application.</p>
<p>The master list of contacts is <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=D927ED39BDAE7478&amp;s=DA2F7BC919B77E24">found here</a>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>whether you should apply eg benefits of the program, vague/early questions
<ul>
<li>Read the <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/Default.aspx">Foreign Talent Act website</a></li>
<li>Ask <a href="https://www.contacttaiwan.tw/main/index.aspx?lang=2#">Contact Taiwan</a>, particularly look out for their events with invited speakers from NIA. They are a Government-funded organisation whose mission is to help you find a job. They&rsquo;ll direct you to the right place</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the online application portal, eg errors, ambiguous fields: Contact NIA, under the <em>Ministry of Interior for Employment Gold Card Permits for Foreign Special Professionals</em> on the master list</li>
<li>skill qualification, eg required documents, why your initial set of documents was rejected: Contact the appropriate ministry under <em>Qualification of Foreign Special Professionals</em> on the master list</li>
<li>status of your application eg where it is now, why it&rsquo;s taking so long: See &ldquo;How do I find out the status of my application?&rdquo;</li>
<li>visas for your spouse/family: Contact NIA, under the <em>Ministry of Interior for Employment Gold Card Permits for Foreign Special Professionals</em> on the master list</li>
<li>income tax reduction eg whether you qualify, how it works: the NIA can sometimes provide some basic information about this, otherwise contact the Ministry of Finance under <em>Reduction or Exemption of Income Tax of Foreign Special Professionals</em> on the master list</li>
<li>A particular agency&rsquo;s implementation of the program eg make an appeal or complaint, talk to &ldquo;whoever&rsquo;s in charge&rdquo;: Contact the National Development Council.</li>
