      <description>The Taiwan Employment Gold Card is a combined visa, work permit and residence permit launched in 2018 to attract professional talent in Taiwan. The card gives you the right to stay and work in Taiwan for 1 year to 3 years, and you can apply online without sponsorship. The card comes with open work rights, so you may work for any (or multiple) company in Taiwan or start your own business.</description>

      <description>What do I need to tell my employer about the Gold Card? Your Gold Card is a four-in-one document that contains your work permit, residence visa, reentry permit and Alien Residence Certificate. You have open work rights and they do not need to apply for a work permit or visa for you.
What happens if I lose my job? You may simply find a new job. Your Gold Card is not sponsored by your employer and will not be affected by a change of job.</description>

The most popular property search website is 591. Unlike in some other countries, real estate agents offering rental properties in Taiwan are typically only brokers who present prospective tenants to landlords for a fee and you will normally deal directly with a landlord from lease signing onward.</description>

      <description>Should I switch from an APRC to a Gold Card? According to NIA officials, no. They stress that this card is nonrenewable and you must go through the application process again toward the end of the gold card. One way of looking at that is that the Foreign Special Professional program could change to the point where one no longer qualifies. APRC is therefore ‚Äúsafer‚Äù in the long term.
Consider also if the program doesn‚Äôt change.</description>

      <description>How long is a gold card valid? By default, between one and three years. If you are concerned your card (or underlying visa/work permit) may have become invalid or expired, you can check with the National Immigration Agency.
Can I renew my gold card? A &amp;lsquo;renewal&amp;rsquo; is almost the same as a new application. Your &amp;lsquo;renewal&amp;rsquo; application will still go through skill assessment like your first one, and it has been stated that your activities in Taiwan during your first card will form part of the assessment.</description>

      <description>General Guidelines Regardless of which bank you choose, you will need to follow the following procedures:
 Bring your Employment Gold Card and another proof of your identity (passport). Go to a bank near the address stated on your Employment Gold Card. For example, you cannot go to Xinyi to open a bank account if your residential address is at Sanchong. Prepare a local Taiwan number. This is needed for most banks to send OTP for login to your internet banking portal.</description>
