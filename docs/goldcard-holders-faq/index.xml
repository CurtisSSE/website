      <description>What do I need to tell my employer about the Gold Card? Your Gold Card is a four-in-one document that contains your work permit, residence visa, reentry permit and Alien Residence Certificate. You have open work rights and they do not need to apply for a work permit or visa for you.
What happens if I lose my job? You may simply find a new job. Your Gold Card is not sponsored by your employer and will not be affected by a change of job.</description>

      <description>What health insurance is available in Taiwan? All who are eligible for National Health Insurance (NHI) must enrol into the program, which provides comprehensive and inexpensive coverage. Eligibility varies slightly depending on your employment status. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t eligible for NHI then there are also a range of local and international private health insurance options available.
You can check the NHI website for more details.
How do I enrol into the program If you have an employer in Taiwan then they will enrol you into the program.</description>

      <description>Can I purchase real-estate? In general, yes, if your country allows Taiwanese nationals to purchase real estate in your country. There are some restrictions, such as not being able to purchase farmland, or land related to a waterway or national defense.
Does my card look any different from other types of ARC? Yes, the entire card is gold in colour. It also has slightly different information such as a different title (R.</description>

      <description>Should I switch from an APRC to a Gold Card? According to NIA officials, no. They stress that this card is nonrenewable and you must go through the application process again toward the end of the gold card. One way of looking at that is that the Foreign Special Professional program could change to the point where one no longer qualifies. APRC is therefore “safer” in the long term.
Consider also if the program doesn’t change.</description>

      <description>Note: Everyone has a different situation. Please consult an accountant before relying on content from this section.
 How do I apply for the tax relief for Foreign Special Professionals? As a Gold Card holder working in Taiwan for the first time, for the portion of your salary over NT $3 million, half of it can be excluded from your effective income for your first three years of residence. eg if your salary was NT $6 million, you only pay tax on NT $4.</description>

      <description>Can my spouse and children come with me if I get a Gold Card? Yes, for children under 20 years old and married spouses this is no problem.
Can my spouse work, if they join me in Taiwan as a dependant? The Gold Card does not provide for a work permit for dependants of the card holder. Your spouse should get their own work permit.
What happens if I get married to a Taiwanese citizen while on a Gold Card?</description>

      <description>How long is a gold card valid? By default, between one and three years. If you are concerned your card (or underlying visa/work permit) may have become invalid or expired, you can check with the National Immigration Agency.
Can I renew my gold card? No. There is no renewal capability for a Gold Card. You must complete the same application process you went through for your first card for all subsequent cards.</description>
