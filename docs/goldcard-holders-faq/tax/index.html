<h2 id="how-do-i-apply-for-the-tax-relief-for-foreign-special-professionals">How do I apply for the tax relief for Foreign Special Professionals?</h2>
<p>As a Gold Card holder working in Taiwan for the first time, for the portion of your salary over
NT $3 million, half of it can be excluded from your effective income for your first three years
of residence. eg if your salary was NT $6 million, you only pay tax on NT $4.5 million.</p>
<p>There is a special form accessible from both the Alien e-Filing system and the paper-based tax
return application.</p>
<h2 id="if-i-have-worked-in-taiwan-before-can-i-apply-for-the-tax-break">If I have worked in Taiwan before, can I apply for the tax break?</h2>
<p>Generally no, with some exceptions. The relevant regulations are <a href="https://law.moj.gov.tw/eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=G0340150%204">here</a>.
You can see in Article 3 that you need 3 ticks to be eligible:</p>
<ol>
<li>First time coming to work</li>
<li>It’s special professional work</li>
<li>No household registration (only applicable to ROC nationals) and not a tax resident for the prior 5 years</li>
</ol>
<p>With the exception that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a foreign special professional has been previously approved to reside in the R.O.C. before
his/her employment engaged in the professional work in the R.O.C., and such approval is not given
on the ground of his/her engagement in the professional work, he/she shall not be subject to the
first-time approval requirement…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is unclear.</p>
<p>In 2019, <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/News_Content.aspx?n=F0746484B877D582&amp;s=AB4D1406453F1C22">an interpretation</a>
was issued on this matter. An attempt to explain it is below, but this
has not been validated by official sources.</p>
<p>If you came to Taiwan in 2015/2016/2017 and had a single 3/2/1 year work contract that ended in 2018
and you became a Gold Card holder in 2018 and got a new contract … for financial year 2018 (and 2019
and 2020) you can claim the Gold Card tax break.</p>
<p>You are not eligible under this interpretation if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you worked in Taiwan before 2015</li>
<li>your contract didn’t extend into 2018</li>
<li>you had multiple contracts between 2015 and 2018.</li>
<li>you became a gold card holder in 2019</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-do-i-file-tax-in-taiwan">When do I file tax in Taiwan?</h2>
<p>The financial year is January 1st to December 31st. Tax is filed each year from May 1st to the end of the month.</p>
<p>2020 benefits from an <a href="https://home.kpmg/us/en/home/insights/2020/04/tnf-taiwan-tax-return-tax-payment-deadlines-extended-covid-19.html">extended deadline due to the COVID-19</a>. You are allowed to fill tax until the 30rd June 2020.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-calculate-my-tax">How do I calculate my tax?</h2>
<p>A useful <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_UNRjnQXEdcUYLkw-Hqo1K22RE1QAjIFelvtp0nD0mY/edit#gid=1372091174">tax calculator is available here</a>, if you need a rough estimate and can&rsquo;t work the <a href="https://www.etax.nat.gov.tw/etwmain/front/ETW158W13?site=en">official
website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="where-can-i-go-for-help-with-my-taxes">Where can I go for help with my taxes?</h2>
<p>The National Taxation Bureau provides free professional taxation consultation sessions <a href="https://www.ntbt.gov.tw/English/multiplehtml/51c544ce868347fa85b4d63bcaee4559">in English and Japanese</a>.
During &ldquo;tax season&rdquo; there are dedicated English language counters for tax filing at
National Taxation Bureau offices in major cities.</p>
